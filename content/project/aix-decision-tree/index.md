This app wants to give you an intuitive understanding of what machine learning is. It's not just neural networks, and it's not black magic. Your task is to help Bob, a newly arriving student in Tübingen. Bob needs an apartment, but he's not sure which rents are appropriate for which kind of apartments. After all, different parts of the town have different rent standards. Help him create a so-called 'decision tree' to divide the town into areas with similar rents, and then compete against the AI to see who's better at estimating rents!

This project was part of the AI exhibition at the Stadtmuseum Tübingen which ran from 2023 to 2024. I'm very happy that I got to make at least a small contribution to the public AI discourse :)
