MSc Research Project at the [Methods of Machine Learning Group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/start/), supervised by [Marvin Pf√∂rtner](https://marvinpfoertner.github.io).

The project explored techniques to scale probabilistic PDE solvers to larger, more complex problems. The animation above demonstrates the result of this work: A simulation of the 1D shallow-water equations. This was not tractable within the previous framework.

I eventually continued this line of work into my PhD, [which resulted in the GP-FVM paper.](/publication/scaling-probabilistic-pde/)
