Joint work with Mattia Masiero. This was our final project for the Data Literacy course at the University of TÃ¼bingen in WS21/22.

If I hand you the transcript of a political speech held in the German Bundestag, can you guess which party the speaker belongs to? We explore different techniques to build a classifier that takes a transcript and predicts a political party. In the end, we obtain a fair classifier that achieves $\approx 50$% accuracy, which is three times better than pure guessing. The classifier is fair in the sense that there are no large margins in prediction performance between large and small parties.
